Now to install this Rubrics module, just copy the root directory(name of the directory is rubric) 
of this README file with all the files inside, into the $HOME/mod directory. Here $HOME is 
the root directory where Moodle is installed in the system. Now login to Moodle as 
administrator. Go to notification page. It will show the database and other installation 
notifications, press continue and you are done. :)
