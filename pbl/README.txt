This module works only with Moodle 1.9.x version.
With the standard Moodle package *Rubric Module* and *File Manager Block* need to be 
installed in the system, before you install the *PBL module*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you install the PBL module, you need to install the *Rubric Module* and the 
*File Manager Block*. As you untar the PBL.tar.gz these two plug-in will be also there 
inside the untar directory.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now to install, just copy the root directory with all the files inside, into the $HOME/mod
directory. Here $HOME is the root directory where Moodle is installed in the system. Now 
login to Moodle as administrator. Go to notification page. It will show the database and 
other installation notifications, press continue and you are done. :)
